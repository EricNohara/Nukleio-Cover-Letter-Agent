Other attendees can join the same event room and add their own “echo” — a photo and thought — building a community-generated timeline and memory wall for that event. Over time, each event’s location becomes a shared memory space, where users can relive collective experiences and see different perspectives. Additionally, users can upvote or downvote contributions, with the best ones being pinned to the top and earning contributor points.",
